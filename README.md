# Predict_Sales_Of_a_Product

The goal of this project is to predict for some period in the future what would be the sales of a product.
I have applied different forecasting techniques as ARIMA and SARIMAX from `statsmodels` and also the library `fbprophet`.

This project was carried out as part of Udemy course: Data Science Real-World Use Cases - Hands On Python.
